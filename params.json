I\r\nwant to see the names of those bosses are left alive while the raid finder window is open. You can get the\r\nsame information through the default UI, but it takes several clicks to get to it, and it hides behind the\r\nraid finder window.\r\n\r\n## How do I use it?\r\n\r\nThis addon integrates with LibDataBroker compatible panels (such as Bazooka and Titan Panel), so you can simply\r\nclick on the icon to open the window. Or, you can type `/whichbossesareleft`.\r\n\r\n![Addon image top](../images/which-bosses-are-left_top.png)\r\n\r\n![Addon image bottom](../images/which-bosses-are-left_bottom.png)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
