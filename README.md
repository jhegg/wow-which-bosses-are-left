# Which Bosses Are Left?
---

A World of Warcraft addon that shows which Legion raid bosses have not been
killed this week.

## What does it do?

WhichBossesAreLeft shows which Emerald Nightmare
raid bosses you have not yet killed for the week. Three difficulties are tracked:
Looking For Raid, Normal, and Heroic.

## How do I use it?

This addon integrates with LibDataBroker compatible panels (such as Bazooka and
Titan Panel), so you can simply mouseover the LDB icon, or click on the icon
to open a moveable window. Or, you can type `/whichbossesareleft` to open
the window.

## Why would I use this?

I wrote this addon to make it easier to use the Raid Finder for normal and
heroic difficulty Draenor raids, and then updated it for Legion. For example,
I may have missed a guild raid night, and still need to kill one or more
bosses for the week. I want to see the names of those bosses that are left
alive while the raid finder window is open. You can get the same information
through the default UI, but it takes several clicks to get to it, and it
hides behind the raid finder window.

Based on a request, this addon will now also display which Looking For Raid
difficulty bosses are available for the week.
