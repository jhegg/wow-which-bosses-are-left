# Which Bosses Are Left?
---

A World of Warcraft addon that shows which Draenor raid bosses have not been killed this week.

## What does it do?

I wrote this addon to make it easier to use the Raid Finder for normal and heroic difficulty Draenor raids.
For example, I may have missed a guild raid night, and still need to kill one or more bosses for the week. I
want to see the names of those bosses are left alive while the raid finder window is open. You can get the
same information through the default UI, but it takes several clicks to get to it, and it hides behind the
raid finder window.

## How do I use it?

This addon integrates with LibDataBroker compatible panels (such as Bazooka and Titan Panel), so you can simply
click on the icon to open the window. Or, you can type `/whichbossesareleft`.
